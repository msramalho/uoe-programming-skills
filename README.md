Percolate


# Questions to the professor:
1. The dat file was being written in a flipped manner and I reverted it back to the normal perspective, is that supposed to be what we do or is there a reason to leave it as it was?
2. The percolation testing loop is actually checking if there is a percolation from left to right instead of top to bottom.
3. while writing the pgm file there is a moment where information is printed to the console AFTER the pgm file is open, however it would make more sense to print that info before opening the file, is it OK if I make this change?
