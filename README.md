Percolate


# Questions to the professor:
1. The dat file was being written in a flipped manner and I reverted it back to the normal perspective, is that supposed to be what we do or is there a reason to leave it as it was?
2. The percolation testing loop is actually checking if there is a percolation from left to right instead of top to bottom.
